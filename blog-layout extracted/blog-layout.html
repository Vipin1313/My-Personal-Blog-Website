 		<p>★Live Wild and Free★..</p>
 		<p>Don't be contained. Don't follow a model. Grow wild. And you're gonna face way more push back doing that. But just being like “Nope I'm just gonna be completely free as me and I don't care.” I mean I'm gonna behave in a benevolent way. It's not like I don't care in a malevolent way like I'm going to plow you over if you get in the way. I'm not going out of my way to hurt anybody but I'm also not gonna conform to anything. Because that's the expectations of what's been done before. So it's like being wild in a benevolent way.</p>
